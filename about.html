                        <h3>Who am I...?</h3>
                        <p>Hello! I&#39;m Adri&aacute;n, and I&#39;m a 17 y/o student from Spain.</p>
                        <p>I love art as much as I love science so this site is really a collection of everything I like.
                            Since I was little I've been on the internet and playing <a href="games.html">videogames</a>. I truly owe it all to internet culture and I love it lol. 
                            I like making and listening to <a href="music.html">music</a>, and I'm fascinated by sound design and electronics (though I suck at both lol).
                            I'm also a <a href="crochet.html">crocheter</a>, and I've recently started to sew, embroider, and knit too. I love cooking and I make bomb baked potatoes and chickpea salad, so I might make a cookbook here idk.
                            I've also been <a href="writing.html">writing</a> poetry for a long time, and I've attempted to write fanfiction and original stories but they're very unfinished, abandoned, rotting projects.

                    <h1>What is going on...?</h1>
                    <p>Some time ago, a video about the indie web was recommended to me on my YouTube feed.
                        At first, I thought it was a cool idea, but I didn&#39;t really know where to start or what I would do with a personal website anyway.
                        I&#39;ve always been interested in coding, but I&#39;ve never really put all my energy into it since I didn&#39;t know exactly what I wanted to do.
                        It wasn&#39;t until the summer of 2025 that I actually chose this website as my first big coding project.
                        Other than that, the site doesn&#39;t have a real purpose.
                        Maybe in the future it could become a more consistent project, but for now, it&#39;s just a massive dump of things I&#39;m interested in and my projects.
                        If that&#39;s your kind of thing, consider following me!
